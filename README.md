# Mango-Defect-Detection
## Introduction
Human inspectors can be susceptible to
 fatigue, distraction, and individual biases,
 leading to inconsistencies in defect
 identification. A deep learning model is
 objective and consistent, minimizing
 human error.
 Manual inspection is time-consuming and
 labor-intensive, especially for large
 volumes of mangoes. Deep learning models
 can analyze numerous mangoes rapidly,
 boosting efficiency and throughput
 significantly.

## Approach
We have used several combinations of CNNs and also multiple pre trained models like VGG, inception v3 and finally selected the 
inception v3 model having best accuracy, recall and precision of all

We have incorporated the Deep learning approach into the daily lifeâ€™s real time application. And integrated the Machine learning model with development tool flask rather than commonly used javascript which acts as server side of the code
